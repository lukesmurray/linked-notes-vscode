  {"id":"beaudouin-lafonInstrumentalInteractionInteraction2000","abstract":"This article introduces a new interaction model called Instrumental Interaction that extends and generalizes the principles of direct manipulation. It covers existing interaction styles, including traditional WIMP interfaces, as well as new interaction styles such as two-handed input and augmented reality. It defines a design space for new interaction techniques and a set of properties for comparing them. Instrumental Interaction describes graphical user interfaces in terms of domain objects and interaction instruments. Interaction between users and domain objects is mediated by interaction instruments, similar to the tools and instruments we use in the real world to interact with physical objects. The article presents the model, applies it to describe and compare a number of interaction techniques, and shows how it was used to create a new interface for searching and replacing text.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Beaudouin-Lafon","given":"Michel"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems  - CHI '00","DOI":"10.1145/332040.332473","event":"the SIGCHI conference","event-place":"The Hague, The Netherlands","ISBN":"978-1-58113-216-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"language":"en","page":"446-453","publisher":"ACM Press","publisher-place":"The Hague, The Netherlands","source":"Crossref","title":"Instrumental interaction: an interaction model for designing post-WIMP user interfaces","title-short":"Instrumental interaction","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=332040.332473"},
  {"id":"beaudouin-lafonReificationPolymorphismReuse","abstract":"This paper presents three design principles to support the development of large-scale applications and take advantage of recent research in new interaction techniques: Reification turns concepts into first class objects, polymorphism permits commands to be applied to objects of different types, and reuse makes both user input and system output accessible for later use. We show that the power of these principles lies in their combination. Reification creates new objects that can be acted upon by a small set of polymorphic commands, creating more opportunities for reuse. The result is a simpler yet more powerful interface.","author":[{"family":"Beaudouin-Lafon","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Mackay","given":"Wendy E"}],"language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"Reification, Polymorphism and Reuse: Three Principles for Designing Visual Interfaces","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"beaudouin-lafonUnifiedPrinciplesInteraction2017","abstract":"Even though today's computers are used for many different types of tasks, they still rely on user interfaces designed for office workers in the 1980s. HCI researchers have produced a slew of innovative interaction styles, from gestural interaction to mixed reality and tangible interfaces, but they have not replaced traditional GUIs. I argue that we must devise fundamental principles of interaction that unify, rather than separate, interaction styles in order to support the diversity of uses and users. I describe ongoing work on my ERC advanced grant, ONE, which explores how the concepts of information substrates and interaction instruments create digital environments that users can appropriate and (re)combine at will.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Beaudouin-Lafon","given":"Michel"}],"container-title":"CHItaly 2017 - Proceedings of the 12th Biannual Conference of the Italian SIGCHI Chapter","DOI":"10.1145/3125571.3125602","event-place":"Cagliari, Italy","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9]]},"page":"1 - 2","publisher-place":"Cagliari, Italy","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Towards Unified Principles of Interaction","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01614273"},

SnipSuggest aims to help the increasing population of non-expert database users, who need to perform complex analysis on their large-scale datasets, but have difﬁculty writing SQL queries. As a user types a query, SnipSuggest recommends possible additions to various clauses in the query using relevant snippets collected from a log of past queries. SnipSuggest’s current capabilities include suggesting tables, views, and table-valued functions in the FROM clause, columns in the SELECT clause, predicates in the WHERE clause, columns in the GROUP BY clause, aggregates, and some support for sub-queries. SnipSuggest adjusts its recommendations according to the context: as the user writes more of the query, it is able to provide more accurate suggestions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Khoussainova","given":"Nodira"},{"family":"Kwon","given":"YongChul"},{"family":"Balazinska","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Suciu","given":"Dan"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","DOI":"10.14778/1880172.1880175","ISSN":"21508097","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"22-33","source":"Crossref","title":"SnipSuggest: context-aware autocompletion for SQL","title-short":"SnipSuggest","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1880172.1880175","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"klokmoseWebstratesShareableDynamic2015","abstract":"We revisit Alan Kay’s early vision of dynamic media that blurs the distinction between documents and applications. We introduce shareable dynamic media that are malleable by users, who may appropriate them in idiosyncratic ways; shareable among users, who collaborate on multiple aspects of the media; and distributable across diverse devices and platforms. We present Webstrates, an environment for exploring shareable dynamic media. Webstrates augment web technology with real-time sharing. They turn web pages into substrates, i.e. software entities that act as applications or documents depending upon use. We illustrate Webstrates with two implemented case studies: users collaboratively author an article with functionally and visually different editors that they can personalize and extend at run-time; and they orchestrate its presentation and audience participation with multiple devices. We demonstrate the simplicity and generative power of Webstrates with three additional prototypes and evaluate it from a systems perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Klokmose","given":"Clemens N."},{"family":"Eagan","given":"James R."},{"family":"Baader","given":"Siemen"},{"family":"Mackay","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Beaudouin-Lafon","given":"Michel"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software & Technology - UIST '15","DOI":"10.1145/2807442.2807446","event":"the 28th Annual ACM Symposium","event-place":"Daegu, Kyungpook, Republic of Korea","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3779-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"280-290","publisher":"ACM Press","publisher-place":"Daegu, Kyungpook, Republic of Korea","source":"Crossref","title":"<i>Webstrates</i>: Shareable Dynamic Media","title-short":"<i>Webstrates</i>","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2807442.2807446"},

The interface, which is in the form of a single text input box, interacts in real-time with the users as they type, guiding them through the query construction. We discuss the issues of schema and data complexity, result size estimation, and query validity; and provide novel approaches to solving these problems. We demonstrate our query interface on two popular applications; an enterprise-wide personnel search, and a biological information database.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Nandi","given":"Arnab"},{"family":"Jagadish","given":"H.

  {"id":"nandiGuidedInteractionRethinking","abstract":"Many decades of research, coupled with continuous increases in computing power, have enabled highly efficient execution of queries on large databases. In consequence, for many databases, far more time is spent by users formulating queries than by the system evaluating them. It stands to reason that, looking at the overall query experience we provide users, we should pay attention to how we can assist users in the holistic process of obtaining the information they desire from the database, and not just the constituent activity of efficiently generating a result given a complete precise query. In this paper, we examine the conventional query-result paradigm employed by databases and demonstrate challenges encountered when following this paradigm for an information seeking task. We recognize that the process of query specification itself is a major stumbling block. With current computational abilities, we are at a point where we can make use of the data in the database to aid in this process. To this end, we propose a new paradigm, guided interaction, to solve the noted challenges, by using interaction to guide the user through the query formulation, query execution and result examination processes. The user can be given advance information during query specification that can not only assist in query formulation, but may also lead to abandonment of an unproductive query direction or the satisfaction of information need even before the query specification is complete. There are significant engineering challenges to constructing the system we envision, and the technological building blocks to address these challenges exist today. 1.","author":[{"family":"Nandi","given":"Arnab"}],"source":"CiteSeer","title":"Guided Interaction: Rethinking the Query-Result Paradigm ABSTRACT","title-short":"Guided Interaction","type":"book"}
